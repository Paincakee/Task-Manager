Start by creating a login and registration system using PHP and MySQL. You'll need to store user credentials securely in a database, and validate logins with server-side code.

Once you have a user authentication system in place, create a dashboard where users can view their tasks. You can use HTML and CSS to create a clean, user-friendly interface.

Use JavaScript to add interactivity to the task manager. For example, you could allow users to add new tasks, edit existing tasks, and mark tasks as complete.

Use PHP to handle the backend logic of the task manager. For example, you'll need to write code to save new tasks to the database, update existing tasks, and delete completed tasks.

Finally, test your application thoroughly to make sure it works as expected. You may want to consider adding features like email notifications or reminders to make the task manager more useful for users.

Overall, a web-based task manager can be a great project to showcase your skills in JavaScript, HTML, and PHP. It can also be a useful tool for staying organized and productive!
